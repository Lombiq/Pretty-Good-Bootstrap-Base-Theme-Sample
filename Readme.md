# Pretty Good Bootstrap Base Theme Orchard Theme Sample Readme



This theme demonstrates how to build themes on top of Lombiq.PrettyGoodBootstrapBaseTheme, or PGBBT for short.

Notice that this theme has the "BaseTheme: Lombiq.PrettyGoodBootstrapBaseTheme" declaration in its Theme.txt so PGBBT is used as its base theme. Also note that if you want to see the zone map under Widgets on the admin you should have your own ThemeZonePreview.png in your theme, just as it is here.

This sample is just demonstrating the usage of PGBBT: if you haven't already you also should read the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/) documentation, and only [that of PGBBT](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Bootstrap-Base-Theme/blob/master/Readme.md).  
You'll need PGBBT also installed for the theme to work (in a folder called Lombiq.PrettyGoodBootstrapBaseTheme as that project is named as such).

For the best development experience we advise you to use Visual Studio with the [Web Essentials extension](http://vswebessentials.com/) installed.

BTW if you want to add a custom favicon to your team just drop it into the Images folder like it was done here! (Make sure to have you favicons adapted to multiple sizes. This can be easily done with multi-layer icons that can be [simply generated](http://convertico.org/).)

You'll be guided by comments everywhere. Start with site.less!

Just as PGBBT this theme is also only compatible with Orchard 1.x (to-be 1.8). You can easily backport it to 1.7.x by swapping out the root Web.config with one from a built-in 1.7.x theme.
