Just as with shape insertions (and Insertions.cshtml/AdditionalInsertions.cshtml) you can specify static resource inclusion that build
on top of what's already in PGBBT. You can also override everything that PGBBT has like this if you create a Resources.cshtml instead.
If you take a look at that file in PGBBT you'll get an idea how this works.
